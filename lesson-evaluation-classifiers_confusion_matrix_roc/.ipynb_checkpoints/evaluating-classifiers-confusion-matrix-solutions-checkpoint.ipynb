    "- It compares the true positive rate to the false positive rate **as the threshold for predicting 1 changes**.\n",
    "- When the area under the curve is 0.50, this is equivalent to the baseline (chance) prediction.\n",
    "- When the area under the curve is 1.00, this is equivalent to perfect prediction.\n",

    "- As the class assignment threshold increases for the positive class (has cancer), the false positive rate and true positive rate necessarily increase.\n",
    "- For a classifier performing at chance, this is the diagonal dotted line: an equal chance of false positives and true positives.\n",
    "- The greater the area under the curve, the higher the ratio of true positives to false positives as the threshold becomes more lenient.\n",
    "- The greater the area under the curve, the higher the quality of the classification model. \n",
    "- Most classification problems will never get close to a full 1.0 area under the curve: the wisconsin breast cancer data is unique in that the signal is extremely strong.
